Zhang was born in 1881[1] in Yi County (now Laizhou) in Shandong.[2] His family was poor. Zhang's father worked as head shaver and trumpeter,[3] and was an alcoholic.[4] His mother was an exorcist[3] and "practicing witch".[4] His parents eventually separated. Zhang stayed with his mother who had taken a new lover.[4] In his teens, Zhang's family moved to Manchuria, where Zhang became involved in petty crime in Harbin.[1] He successively worked as a pickpocket, bouncer, and prospector. At some point, he worked in Siberia, learning Russian.[4] Zhang eventually became a bandit in the Chinese countryside, though he served as auxiliary for the Imperial Russian Army during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905. Following the conflict, he returned to crime and rose to lead his own bandit gang.[5]

His activities during the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 are unclear,[5] though he reportedly led a group of "revolutionary desperados" at the time.[4] At first, he ended up in Jiangsu, where he joined an army regiment. He impressed his commanding officer Cheng Dechuan so much that he appointed Zhang his successor. Afterwards, Zhang and his regiment operated under Division Commander Leng Yuqin, battling bandit groups.[6] When the Second Revolution broke out in 1913, Leng sided with the revolutionaries and was killed, resulting in Zhang becoming the division's commander.[5][6] However, the division's connection with the revolutionaries caused General Feng Guozhang to disband the entire unit, reducing Zhang to a merely symbolic role. He responded by murdering the revolutionary Chen Qimei in Shanghai in 1916, proving himself loyal and reliable to Feng. When the latter became Vice President of the Republic of China, he appointed Zhang the commander of his personal guard.[6]

Zhang returned to Manchuria in 1922, and joined the Fengtian clique of warlord Zhang Zuolin.[5] He made a good impression, with one story being that he rose in popularity one year at Zhang Zuolin's birthday party: in contrast to other guests who showered the warlord with expensive gifts, Zhang Zongchang sent him two empty coolie baskets and failed to turn up himself. Zhang Zuolin was baffled until the purpose of the gift was ascertained: Zhang Zongchang's empty basket implied he was a man willing to shoulder whatever heavy responsibilities the warlord entrusted him with. He was subsequently rewarded with a command position in his army, though only after proving himself in battle did Zhang Zongchang visit his superior in person.

Zhang Zongchang proved to be one of the more capable warlord generals, making effective use of armored trains.[7][8] Aided by his knowledge of the Russian language,[9][10] he recruited thousands of White Russian refugees from the Russian Civil War;[7][8] he organised the men into specialised units, including a unit of Cossack bodyguards,[7] and crews for his armored trains.[11] He even outfitted some White Russians with pseudo-Tsarist uniforms and regalia.[citation needed] He was also one of the first Chinese generals to incorporate women into the military on a large scale, including using a regiment of nurses consisting entirely of White Russian women. They trained their Chinese counterparts, resulting in greater efficiency in taking care of Zhang's wounded troops, a significant boost for morale and combat capability.[7] He also organized his own small air force, including at least one Caudron C.59 bomber.[12]

Rise to prominence and rule of Shandong
In 1924, he took part in the Second Zhili–Fengtian War, capturing the crucial Lengkouguan Pass after the Zhili clique's defenses were thrown into chaos due to Feng Yuxiang's betrayal. This boosted Zhang's reputation within the Fengtian clique.[13] He later helped partition Shanghai between the opposing forces. In April 1925 he conquered Shanghai proper and then seized Nanjing, both for the glory of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian clique. From then on, Zhang was very active in Shanghai for both work and pleasure.[13] He often caroused in the city with Zhang Zuolin's son, Gen. Zhang Xueliang. Both men enjoyed opium,[citation needed] for which Shanghai was a key site in the smuggling trade, and the Fengtian economy became increasingly reliant on the drug. Zhang became closely connected to Shanghai's criminal gangs and the drug trade. Later in 1925, Zhang and his forces were ousted from Shanghai.[13] He was subsequently appointed military governor of Shandong, which he ruled as warlord until May 1928.[5]

Zhang's rule of Shandong was notoriously poor, dominated by graft and mismanagement. He implemented excessive taxes, printed so much provincial currency that it became worthless, and starved public institutions of funds. By 1927, the provincial educational system had collapsed and the local economy was in tatters. Any opposition was brutally suppressed;[14] when a newspaper criticized his regime, Zhang promptly ordered its editor shot.[5] Peasants banded together as part of the Red Spear Society, revolting against Zhang's reign in the countryside. Although poorly armed, these insurgents proved to be a major threat to smaller units belonging to Zhang's army.[14] At the same time, Zhang set up his headquarters in Jinan like a "medieval court" with lavish entertainment and grand feasts.[14][10] He also acted as benefactor for artists, writers, entertainers, arms dealers, drug kingpins, diplomats, and Western journalists.[14]

When the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT) launched the Northern Expedition, Zhang remained firmly loyal to the Fengtian clique, briefly retaking Shanghai before his army was driven north.[14] As his position in Shandong was threatened to be overrun, Zhang requested a resident German technician named Franz Oster to build more aircraft for his air force to counter the advancing KMT. Oster constructed a plane, but when it was shipped to Zhang's headquarters, it was found to be so badly designed that it could not even get off the ground.[15] In 1928, NRA troops led by Bai Chongxi defeated and destroyed Zhang Zongchang's army, capturing 20,000 of his 50,000 troops and almost capturing Zhang himself, who escaped beyond the Great Wall to Manchuria.[16] Regardless, he and the remnants of his army were able to escape northward with much loot from Shandong. The province was left in chaos following his flight.[14] Even after the loss of Shandong and the murder of Fengtian leader Zhang Zuolin, Zhang Zongchang wanted to resist the NRA. When the succeeding Fengtian commander Zhang Xueliang (son of the former murdered leader Zhang Zuolin) intended to make peace with the KMT, Zhang and his follower Chu Yupu revolted and attempted to overthrow him. However, the combined NRA-Zhang Xueliang forces crushed Zhang Zongchang's army. In the end, even his Russian mercenaries betrayed him.[17]

Exile activities
As his army disintegrated, Zhang fled to Japanese protection in Dalian, though remained unwilling to accept his reduced status. From Dalian,[18] he hatched several plots to regain his former territories.[14] Possibly enjoying covert support by Japan, Zhang, his long-time follower Chu Yupu and another warlord, Huang Feng-chi, returned to Shandong in 1929 and launched a major rebellion against Liu Zhennian, the Nationalist-aligned de facto ruler of eastern Shandong at the time. Gathering tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers who were still loyal to them, the three warlords fought for several months against Liu's followers, thereby causing great destruction and many casualties among the civilian population.[18] Zhang also instigated a parallel revolt in Beijing that was quickly suppressed.[19] In the end, the Shandong rebellion was defeated, but Zhang managed to escape back to Dalian.[18] This time, the Japanese authorities of the Kwantung Leased Territory did not allow Zhang to reenter Dalian. As a result, he travelled to Moji in Japan instead.[20]

Later that year, he was living quietly in Beppu, Japan, with his mother, though he was thrown into the spotlight again when he "accidentally" shot Prince Xiankai (憲開), a cousin of the deposed emperor Puyi. According to Zhang the gun he was holding while standing at his hotel window happened to go off and shoot the young prince in the back, killing him instantly, though it was more likely he killed the playboy prince for dallying with one of Zhang's many concubines. He was charged, found guilty by a Japanese court and given the choice between 15 days' imprisonment or a $150 (US) fine. He chose the fine.[21]

Declaring his intention to assist the Chinese resistance against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Zhang visited some of his former comrades in Jinan on 3 September 1932. When he returned to the city's railway station to travel to Beijing, Zhang was assassinated by the nephew of an officer whom he had executed. His last words were reportedly "No good!"[14] The assassin was granted clemency and pardoned by the Kuomintang government. Contemporary claims were made that the "filial murder" might have been part of a plan set up by a local governor to remove Zhang as a political rival.[22][23] It was also suspected that ex-warlord Feng Yuxiang was involved in the murder.[14]

Legacy
Zhang was buried in the Western Hills near Beijing. His funeral attracted family members, ex-retainers, paid mourners, and "the curious"; the funeral procession stretched for 2 miles (3.2 km).[14] After his death, a shop clerk named Liang Zuoyou claimed to have found a $30 million check belonging to the Nanjing government on Zhang's body. Finance Minister T. V. Soong provided Liang with a first-class train ticket to personally return the check to the state treasury in Nanjing. However, Liang had "misread" the number, as the check was only worth $300,000. The government was ridiculed by the press for the event, while the clerk greatly profited, as he had exchanged the first-class ticket for a third-class one and pocketed the difference.[24]

As a result of rumours of his great wealth, Zhang's tomb was repeatedly targeted and raided by grave robbers. It was also opened by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, but the communists found only a single tablet.[14] In modern China, Zhang is still mainly remembered as a "wicked warlord" representing the violent excesses of his era.[25]
